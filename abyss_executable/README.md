# Executable
The executable must be run in the terminal with ./ due to that paths of the assets

# Mac Run Instructions 

1. Open the folder and find the file Abyss (not Abyss.py), RIGHT CLICK it and press open AND open again 
2. Terminal might open or something else and the program will fail but this is a necessary step due to mac permissions from unknown downloaded files 
3. Open a new Terminal. (command + spacebar and type "terminal" + return)
4. Type "cd ~/downloads/abyss_executable" (without the quotes) and press 'return'. (Assuming the file downloaded into your downloads folder.)
5. If it says "permission denied" try "cd ~/downloads" then "cd abyss_executable"
6. Type "./Abyss" (without the quotes) and press return. If it gives you "permission denied", type "chmod +x Abyss" (without the qutoes) and press return. Do "./Abyss" again
