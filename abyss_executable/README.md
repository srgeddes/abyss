# General 

Abyss is a game developed using UVAGE and pygame. The goal of the game is to reach the top and escape the black hole using 
your spaceship to travel faster than the speed of light. Along the way you must collect all the stars and answer the questions
correctly. If you are caught by the black hole and answer a question incorrectly you lose. If you answer two questions
incorrectly you lose. 

Here is a video of me explaining and demoing the game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCZzOkQ5Ndc

# Keybindings  

1. return = start  
2. spacebar = jump 
3. right / left arrow = move
4. a/b/c/d = answer question

# Executable
The executable must be run in the terminal with ./ due to that paths of the assets

# Mac Run Instructions 

1. Open the folder and find the file Abyss (not Abyss.py), RIGHT CLICK it and press open AND open again 
2. Terminal might open or something else and the program will fail but this is a necessary step due to mac permissions from unknown downloaded files 
3. Open a new Terminal. (command + spacebar and type "terminal" + return)
4. Type "cd ~/downloads/abyss_executable" (without the quotes) and press 'return'. (Assuming the file downloaded into your downloads folder.)
5. If it says "permission denied" try "cd ~/downloads" then "cd abyss_executable"
6. Type "./Abyss" (without the quotes) and press return. If it gives you "permission denied", type "chmod +x Abyss" (without the qutoes) and press return. Do "./Abyss" again
