3. Open the folder and find the file Abyss (not Abyss.py), right click on it and press open and open again
4. Terminal might open or something else and the program will fail but this is a necessary step due to mac permissions from unknown downloaded files 
5. Open a new Terminal. (command + spacebar and type "terminal" + return)
6. run "cd ~/downloads/abyss_executable" assuming the file downloaded into your downloads folder 
7. If it says "permission denied" try "cd ~/downloads" then "cd abyss_executable"
8. Type "./Abyss" if it gives you "permission denied" run "chmod +x Abyss" and try "./Abyss" again
9. The game should open
